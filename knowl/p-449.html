<div class="para">A good way to prepare for sketching a plane is to find the intersection points of the plane with the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>- and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axes, just as you are used to doing when sketching lines in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. For example, any point on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis must be of the form <span class="process-math">\((x,0,0)\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\((x,0,0)\)</span> to also be on <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> we need <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{12}{4}=3\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> intersects the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> intersects the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis at <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis at <span class="process-math">\((0,0,6)\text{.}\)</span> Now plot the points <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,0,6)\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the plane containing these three points. Often a visually effective way to sketch a surface in three dimensions is to</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. That is, the part with <span class="process-math">\(x\ge0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\ge 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\ge 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To do so, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane in the first octant and,</div></li>
<li><div class="para">similarly, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span>-plane in the first octant and the curve of intersection of the surface with the part of the <span class="process-math">\(yz\)</span>-plane in the first octant.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">That’s what we’ll do. The intersection of the plane <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane is the straight line through the two points <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\text{.}\)</span> So the part of that intersection in the first octant is the line segment from <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\text{.}\)</span> Similarly the part of the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment from <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0,0,6)\)</span> and  the part of the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(yz\)</span>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment from <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0,0,6)\text{.}\)</span> So we just have to sketch the three line segments joining the three axis intercepts <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((0,4,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,0,6)\text{.}\)</span> That’s it.</div>
