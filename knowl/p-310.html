<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let’s get back to the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. We will be using both scalars and vectors. So, for each operation there are three possibilities that we need to explore:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">“scalar plus scalar”, “scalar plus vector” and “vector plus vector”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">“scalar times scalar”, “scalar times vector” and “vector times vector”</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">We have been using “scalar plus scalar” and “scalar times scalar” since childhood. “vector plus vector” and “scalar times vector” were just defined above. There is no sensible way to define “scalar plus vector”, so we won’t. This leaves “vector times vector”. There are actually two widely used such products. The first is the <em class="emphasis">dot product</em>, which is the topic of this section, and which is used to easily determine the angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> (or more precisely, <span class="process-math">\(\cos\theta\)</span>) between two vectors. We’ll get to the second, the cross product, later.</div>
