<div class="para">Consider a parallelogram in three dimensions. A parallelogram is naturally determined by the two vectors that define its sides. One measure of the size of a parallelogram is its area. One way to specify the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector that is perpendicular to it. A very compact way to encode both the area and the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane in which it lies and whose magnitude is its area. We shall see that such a vector can be easily constructed by taking the cross product (definition coming shortly) of the two vectors that give the sides of the parallelogram.</div>
