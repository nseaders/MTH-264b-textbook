<li><div class="para">On the first leg of our walk, we go 4 units in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction. So our displacement vector — the vector whose tail is at our starting point and whose head is at the end point of the first leg — is <span class="process-math">\(\llt 4,0\rgt\text{.}\)</span> As we started at <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> we finish the first leg of the walk at <span class="process-math">\((4,0)\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">On the second leg of our walk, our direction of motion is northeast, i.e. is <span class="process-math">\(45^\circ\)</span> above the direction of the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. Looking at the figure on the right above, we see that our displacement vector, for the second leg of the walk, has to be in the same direction as the vector <span class="process-math">\(\llt 1,1\rgt\text{.}\)</span> So our displacement vector is the vector of length <span class="process-math">\(5\sqrt{2}\)</span> with the same direction as <span class="process-math">\(\llt 1,1\rgt\text{.}\)</span> The vector <span class="process-math">\(\llt 1,1\rgt\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> has length one and our displacement vector is<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
5\sqrt{2}\ \frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}
=5 \llt 1,1\rgt
=\llt 5,5\rgt

</div>If we draw this displacement vector, <span class="process-math">\(\llt 5,5\rgt\)</span> with its tail at <span class="process-math">\((4,0)\text{,}\)</span> the starting point of the second leg of the walk, then its head will be at <span class="process-math">\((4+5, 0+5)=(9,5)\)</span> and that is the end point of the second leg of the walk.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">On the final leg of our walk, we start at <span class="process-math">\((9,5)\)</span> and walk towards <span class="process-math">\((0,11)\text{.}\)</span> The vector from <span class="process-math">\((9,5)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0,11)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\llt 0-9\,,\,11-5\rgt =\llt -9,6\rgt\text{.}\)</span> As we go only one third of the way, our final displacement vector is<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3}\llt -9,6\rgt

</div>If we draw this displacement vector with its tail at <span class="process-math">\((9,5)\text{,}\)</span> the starting point of the final leg, then its head will be at <span class="process-math">\((9-3, 5+2)=(6,7)\)</span> and that is the end point of the final leg of the walk, and our final location.</div></li>
