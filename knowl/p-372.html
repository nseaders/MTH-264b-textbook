<div class="para">In most computations involving rotational motion, the cross product shows up in one form or another. This is one of the main applications of the cross product. Consider, for example, a rigid body which is rotating at a constant rate of <span class="process-math">\(\Omega\)</span> radians per second about an axis whose direction is given by the unit vector <span class="process-math">\(\hat\va\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> be any point on the body. Letâ€™s figure out its velocity. Pick any point on the axis of rotation and designate it as the origin of our coordinate system. Denote by <span class="process-math">\(\vr\)</span> the vector from the origin to the point <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> denote the angle between <span class="process-math">\(\hat\va\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vr\text{.}\)</span> As time progresses the point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> sweeps out a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(R=|\vr\,|\sin\theta\text{.}\)</span>
