<div class="para">Both points and vectors in 2d are specified by two numbers. Until you get used to this, it might confuse you sometimes — does a given pair of numbers represent a point or a vector? To distinguish<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> between the components of a vector and the coordinates of the point at its head, when its tail is at some point other than the origin, we shall use angle brackets rather than round brackets around the components of a vector. For example, the figure below shows the two-dimensional vector <span class="process-math">\(\llt 2,1\rgt\)</span> drawn in three different positions. In each case, when the tail is at the point <span class="process-math">\((u,v)\)</span> the head is at <span class="process-math">\((2+u,1+v)\text{.}\)</span> We warn you that, out in the  real world<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>, no one uses notation that distinguishes between components of a vector and the coordinates of its head — usually round brackets are used for both. It is up to you to keep straight which is being referred to.</div>
