<div class="para">Recall that the action of a linear transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> can be completely determined by a set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> basis vectors. These basis vectors create a coordinate grid. For example, in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> any set of two non-parallel vectors form a basis and a corresponding coordinate grid of parallelograms. The coordinate grid determines a basic area, the area of the parallelogram between the two basis vectors. Since the transformation is linear, the transformed basis vectors either create a transformed parallelogram, or they collapse to a line or the origin. In particular, the areas of the parallelograms are scaled by the transformation and, since we started with a basis, all areas in the plane are scaled by that same amount. How the area is scaled by a transformation on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> is the value of the determinant.</div>
