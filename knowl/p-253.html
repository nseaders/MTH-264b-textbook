<div class="para">As a second example, suppose that you are analyzing the motion of a pendulum. There are three forces acting on the pendulum bob: gravity <span class="process-math">\(\vg\text{,}\)</span> which is pulling the bob straight down, tension <span class="process-math">\(\vt\)</span> in the rod, which is pulling the bob in the direction of the rod, and air resistance <span class="process-math">\(\vr\text{,}\)</span> which is pulling the bob in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. All three forces are acting on the bob. So it is natural to draw all three arrows representing the forces with their tails at the bob.</div>
