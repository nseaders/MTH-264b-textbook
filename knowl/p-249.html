<div class="para">By way of motivation for the definitions of addition and multiplication by a number, imagine that we are out for a walk on the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Suppose that we take a step and, in doing so, we move <span class="process-math">\(a_1\)</span> units parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis and <span class="process-math">\(a_2\)</span> units parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. Then we say that <span class="process-math">\(\llt a_1, a_2\rgt\)</span> is the displacement vector for the step. Suppose now that we take a second step which moves us an additional <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> units  parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis and an additional <span class="process-math">\(b_2\)</span> units  parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, as in the figure on the left below. So the displacement vector for the second step is <span class="process-math">\(\llt b_1, b_2\rgt\text{.}\)</span> All together, we have moved <span class="process-math">\(a_1+b_1\)</span> units  parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis and <span class="process-math">\(a_2+b_2\)</span> units parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. The displacement vector for the two steps combined is <span class="process-math">\(\llt a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2\rgt\text{.}\)</span> We shall define the sum of <span class="process-math">\(\llt a_1, a_2\rgt\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\llt b_1, b_2\rgt\text{,}\)</span> denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\llt a_1, a_2\rgt+\llt b_1,b_2\rgt\text{,}\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(\llt a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2\rgt\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Suppose now that, instead, we decide to step in the same direction as the first step above, but to move twice as far, as in the figure on the right below.
