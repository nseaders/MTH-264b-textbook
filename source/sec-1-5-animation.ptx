    <title>Basic Animation</title>

    <introduction>
        In this section we will create some basic animations in Matplotlib.
        Static graphs convey a lot of information in one visual. 
        The right animation can help you convey complicated information simply.
        Matplotlib has a module called <emph>animation</emph> that makes 
        frames of a changing graph.<fn>Animation
            is basically a slideshow of pictures or frames.
          </fn> 
        First, however, will need to learn about for loops and user-defined functions 
        to efficiently repeat and reuse code.

        <title>Repeating blocks of code with for loops</title>
        <p> 
          A for loop repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence.  
        </p>

        <sage language='python'>
          <input>
            import numpy as np

            list = [] #create an empty Python list

            for i in np.linspace(0,5,6): #for each number in this array 
              list.append(i) #append to our list

            print(np.array(list)) #print list with appended values

            for tval in np.linspace(0,2*np.pi, 5):
              list.append(tval)

            print(np.array(list)) #print list with additional appended values
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Note that we converted the Python list into a Numpy array before printing. 
          NumPy also has an append function that effectively recreates the entire array before appending
          which is inefficient in a for loop.

        <title>Creating a gif in Matplotlib</title>

        <p>
          We can use for loops as a simple way to animate by
          iterating through frames of an altered graph and 
          writing each frame to a gif file using animation's class <c>PillowWriter</c>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways to alter a graph over time. For this example we will 
          start with an empty graph and draw the curve by adding points one at a time.

            #plot an empty curve that we will add to over time
            curve, = ax.plot([],[]) #create an empty graph to animate
            #note: ax.plot returns a list with one element 
            #here we grab the first item in the list and name it curve 

            #decide on a viewing window that doesn't change as the curve grows

        <title>Reusing blocks of code with user-defined functions</title>
        <p> 
          A Python function accepts inputs as arguments and can output through a return statement.
          For example, <c>numpy.sum()</c> takes in an array and returns the sum of the values in that array 
          (along an axis). 
          When we want to reuse code in multiple places, we can create a user-defined function with <c>def</c>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The user-defined function below takes in a radius and outputs the area of a circle. 
        </p>

        <sage language='python'>
          <input>
            import numpy as np

            def circle_area(radius): #signature
              #documentation
              """Compute the area of a circle for a given radius""" 

              #body
              area = np.pi * radius**2
              return area

            print(circle_area(3))

          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          The signature (first line) decides the name of the function and how many arguments the function requires. 
          The next line documents what the function does, triple quoted so you can use multiple lines. Both are 
          followed by the body of code the function runs when called. Once compiled, user defined functions
          can be called just like any other Python function.
        </p>

        <exercise>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Edit the code above to compute the area of a different circle.  
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Note that variables defined inside a function are local to that function.
                What error do you get if you try to print the value of the variable area?  
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </exercise>

        <p>
          User-defined functions organize code into more manageable chunks. 
          If we find ourselves repeating blocks of code, we often should use a function instead.

        <title>Creating an mp4 in Matplotlib</title>

        <p>
          In matplotlib's animation, a class called FuncAnimation can be used to create
          mp4s. FuncAnimation takes a matplotlib figure and iterates through 
          a user-defined function that alters elements of the graph using frames,
          ultimately saving all the frames as an mp4.

              X.append(xval)
              Y.append(np.sin(xval))
              curve.set_data(X,Y)

              return curve,

            ani = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames = frame_values, interval = 20, blit=True)
            ani.save('sinewave.mp4')

        </sage>

        <p>
          The argument <c>interval</c> determines the delay between frames in milliseconds and <c>blit</c> chooses
          whether FuncAnimation recreates the entire figure every frame, or just updates the altered graph
          elements for efficiency.
