      <title>Prologue</title>

      <p>
            This textbook is a work in progress, and is being written specifically for Mechanical Engineering majors at OSU
            to introduce just enough Python code to implement Matrix Algebra taught in MTH 264. 

            You are currently reading a first draft. 
            
            We expect some of our students to know more than we do, and hope, with their permission, to include their ideas and contributions
            to the textbook.
      </p>
      <p>
            Note that instead of needing to install any software on your device we will use embedded SageMathCell.
            You will need a laptop (or tablet with a keyboard) for each class day, however. 
            Laptops are available for checkout in the LBCC library.
